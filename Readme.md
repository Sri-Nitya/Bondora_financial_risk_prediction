# Project Summary
The main purposes of this analysis are to summarize the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among variables.

## Abstract

This project focuses on credit risk modeling for a peer-to-peer lending platform called Bondora. The data used for the study consists of both defaulted and non-defaulted loans collected from Bondora between March 1, 2009, and January 27, 2020. The dataset includes borrowers' demographic and financial information, as well as loan transaction details.

Peer-to-peer lending involves loans that are typically not backed by collateral, and lenders aim to earn higher returns to compensate for the financial risk they undertake. Lenders face information asymmetry, where borrowers have more information about their creditworthiness than the lenders. To make informed decisions, lenders aim to minimize the risk of default for each loan and achieve returns that adequately compensate for the risk involved.

## About the dataset
The dataset is of shape (134529,112) i.e., with 134529 rows and 112 columns. Here is the detailed description of all the columns of the dataset.

| LossGivenDefault                       | Gives the percentage of outstanding exposure at the time of default that an investor is likely to lose if a loan actually defaults. This means the proportion of funds lost for the investor after all expected recovery and accounting for the time value of the money recovered. In general, LGD parameter is intended to be estimated based on the historical recoveries. However, in new markets where limited experience does not allow us more precise loss given default estimates, a LGD of 90% is assumed. |

## The steps involved in this data analysis are

 - [Data preprocessing](#data-preprocessing)
 - [Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratory-data-analysis)
 - [Feature Engineering](#feature-engineering)
 - [Classification Modelling](#classification-modelling)
 - [Regression Modelling](#regression-modelling)
 - [Pipelining](#pipelining)
 - [Deployment](#deployment)

## Data Preprocessing

 - As we know, the size of the dataset is very large. We may not require all the columns that are present in the dataset. 
 - Percentage of **missing values** is calculated for each and every column to analyze the columns with null values. Features with more than 40% missing values were removed. Before removing, observe the columns if we can have any important columns in that. I observed that DefaultDate column is important in order to observe the defaulters and to create our target variable. Rest of the columns were removed and we are left with 77 columns now.
 - **Removing unwanted columns** is also necessary. For example, there may be some columns whose information can be given by other columns like we don't need Date of birth when we know the Age(For analysis purpose). Similarly the other columns. Finally we are left with 48 columns. 
 - To **create the Target variable**, analyze the Status column having 3 type of attributes(Current, Late, Repaid). Drop out the current column and examine defaulters and non defaulters using the DefaultDate given. If the particular borrower has default date then the loan is defaulted(1) otherwise non defaulted(0). This is our new target column after *Binary encoding*
 - Observe the data type of all the features. There are few data type mismatches. Change the data type of the features according to the [description](#about-the-dataset) of the features given. Convert these into *categorical features.*
 - Drop the DefaultDate and Status columns. We no more need them. Also, drop the features related to date. Save the initial preprocessed dataset and the size of the dataset is **77394 rows x 43 columns.**

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on the dataset from the Bondora peer-to-peer lending platform revealed insights about the demographic and financial information of borrowers, as well as loan transactions. By examining the data, patterns, trends, and relationships were identified to gain a better understanding of the dataset. The EDA helped in uncovering important factors that may influence credit risk, such as the borrowers' characteristics and loan attributes. This analysis provided a foundation for further analysis and modeling in the credit risk assessment of the peer-to-peer lending platform.
 * Handle null values by replacing them with mean and mode.

 * County and CreditScoreEsMicroL columns were dropped as we don't need information of County when we have the city and country of the borrower. CreditScoreEsMicrol have more missing values hence it is also dropped. 
 * Univariate and Bivariate analysis were performed. 
 * ## Univariate Analysis
	  -  Identified the outliers. We can see there are lot of outliers present where LoanDuration, MonthlyPaymentDay, are outlier free. There are very few outliers present in columns Age and LiabilitiesTotal.

	  ![Alt text](image-15.png)
	  As we can see, there are also borrowers of low age(0-2) and there are very few outliers for age column. These outliers must be of those 0-2 age.

	  - Countplots of all categorical columns were plotted and we can observe that there are some columns with high not specified/not set data. 
		  - UseOfLoan
		  - MaritalStatus
		  - EmploymentStatus
		  - OccupationArea
		  While HomeOwnershipType, Education and VerificationType have few Not set data and the remaining columns are completely defined

	- From the boolean features
		-   More than 63% customers have no prior credit history in Bondora
		*NewCreditCustomer*
		![Alt text](image-19.png)
		-   The original maturity date has been increased by more than 60 days only for 20% of the loans
		*Restructured*
		![Alt text](image-20.png)
- ## Bivariate Analysis
	- There are **42794** *default borrowers* and **34600** *non default borrowers*. Let's observe the correlated features. 
	![Alt text](image-21.png)
	- From the correlation matrix, 
	![Alt text](image-22.png)
		-   Target variable is highly negatively correlated with PrincipalPaymentsMade
		-  Target variable is positively correlated with InterestAndPenaltyBalance and PrincipalBalance.
		![Alt text](image-23.png)
		 -   AppiledAmount, Amount, MonthlyPayment, PrincipalBalance are highly correlated
		-  Amount, PrincipalPaymentsMade are highly correlated
		- PreviousRepaymentsBeforeLoan is correlated with AmountOfPreviousLoansBeforeLoan
	- Other observations that were made
		- Defaulted loans are high irrespective of gender.
		- Defaulted loans of the customers with no prior history in Bondora are high and Status of default and non default loans are almost equal for customers with prior credit history in Bondora.
		- Defaulted loans of Estonians are less than Non defaulted ones. While all others have Default loans are high.
	- After this EDA we get clear understanding of all the features of the dataset.


## Feature Engineering

* Label encoding of categorical variables. 
* **Mutual Information scores** were calculated for each and every column.
* *Initial MI scores*
![Alt text](image-24.png)
* Outliers were handled by replacing them with the median values. \
* Standardization and normalization were performed in order to scale values. Any of them can be used.
* Top features with high MI Scores were selected as important features. 
`feature_cols = ['InterestAndPenaltyBalance', 'PrincipalPaymentDifference',
       'PrincipalPaymentsMade', 'PrincipalBalance',
       'InterestAndPenaltyPaymentsMade', 'Interest', 'MonthlyPayment',
       'Amount', 'AppliedAmount', 'LanguageCode', 'Rating', 'Country','Restructured','LoanDuration','MonthlyPaymentDay']`
* Principal component analysis was done and the number of components were observed as 3. After pca we find that the performance is not increasing, instead decreasing. So it is not taken into consideration.

## Classification Modelling

It is the mathematical representation of the output of the training process. Our project comes under the category of classification, which is a supervised learning method, we have done modelling using two algorithms

* K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) classifier
* XGBoost classifier Steps involved are:

1. Data Preparation (Already done)

2. Splitting the data

3. Choosing a classification model.

	* The above classification models for chosen for this task
4. Training the Model

5. Model Evaluation

	Using different metrics

	* Accuracy
	* Precision
	* Recall
	* F1 score
	* Area under the ROC Curve(AUC-ROC)
6. Model Validation

	* k-fold cross validation

* We observe XGBClassifier is performing better than KNNClassifier. Let's proceed with XGBClassifier for further deployment. 

## Regression Modelling
Three target variables are created 
- Preferred EMI(Equated Monthly Installment)
- Preferred ELA(Eligible Loan Amount)
- Preferred ROI(Return On Investment)

In Order to calculate EMI we use the formula
`emi = P x R x (1+R)^N / [(1+R)^N-1]`
where 
"P" is the principal loan amount,  
            "N" in tenure in months,  
            "R" is the prevailing interest rate.
 Loan Tenure is calculated from given MaturityDate and LoanDate
`data['LoanTenure'] = (data['MaturityDate'].dt.year - data['Loandate'].dt.year)*12+(data['MaturityDate'].dt.month - data['Loandate'].dt.month)`

To calculate ELA, the following were used
 * A: “AppliedAmount”  
 * R: “Interest”(Interest rate)  
 * N: “LoanTenure”  
 * I: “IncomeTotal”  
 * L: “LiabilitiesTotal”

For each row in the dataset:   
1. Calculate: Total Payment Due = `(A + (A*r) * n   `
2. Calculate: Max allowable amount = `(I – L) * 30% `  
3. If ( Total Payment Due <= Max allowable amount)   
Then ELA = TotalDue    
Else ELA = Max allowable amount

To calculate PROI, certain conditions were mentioned, those can be referred in the notebook. Before PROI, ROI is calculated as
`ROI = Net income/Cost of investment x100`
`data['InterestAmount'] = (data['Amount']*(data['Interest']/100))
data['TotalAmount'] = (data['InterestAmount'] + data['Amount'])` 
`data['ROI'] = (data['InterestAmount'] / data['TotalAmount'])*100`

After creating target variables, regression task was performed using 2 models
- Polynomial Regression 
- Lasso Regression
Polynomial regression was selected for further work as it is giving good R2 score values. 

## Pipelining
* Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical variables. 
* Splitting of the data. 
* Classification pipelining
	```mermaid
	flowchart TD
	A(StandardScalar) --> B(PCA);
	B(PCA) --> C(XGBClassifier);
	```
* Regression pipelining
	```mermaid
	flowchart TD
	A(StandardScalar) --> B(PCA);
	B(PCA) --> C(PolynomialFeatures);
	C(PolynomialFeatures) --> D(LinearRegression)
	```
Two pickle files were saved for further deployment
## Deployment

* Initially a single page web application using html, css and flask with all the required features is created. The pipelined models were implemented and tested with new data. We found the app is working well giving good predictions for both classification and regression tasks.
* Then we have done deployment on render. 
* You can check the deployed web app [here](https://model-deployment-c4be.onrender.com).
